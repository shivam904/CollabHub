# File System Integration Fixes

## âœ… SOLUTION SUMMARY

### 1. File Service Synchronization Issues âœ… **FIXED**

**Problem:**
- File operations causing ECONNRESET errors
- Database sync failures during file uploads
- Inconsistent file tree loading

**Root Cause:**
- Race conditions in concurrent file operations
- Missing error handling in file synchronization
- Improper connection pooling

**Solution:**
- Completely rewrote file synchronization logic
- Added proper error handling and connection management
- Implemented file operation queuing to prevent race conditions

## ðŸ”§ PERMANENT FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Core File System Improvements:

#### **1. Robust File Operations (`Controllers/fileController.js`)**
- âœ… **Queue-based processing** prevents concurrent operation conflicts
- âœ… **Atomic operations** ensure data consistency
- âœ… **Proper error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- âœ… **Connection pooling** for database operations

#### **2. Enhanced Database Integration (`config/db.js`)**
- âœ… **Automatic reconnection** on connection drops
- âœ… **Connection monitoring** with health checks
- âœ… **Error recovery** mechanisms

#### **3. Improved File Tree Management (`Controllers/folderController.js`)**
- âœ… **Lazy loading** for large directory structures
- âœ… **Efficient caching** to reduce database queries
- âœ… **Real-time updates** via WebSocket synchronization
